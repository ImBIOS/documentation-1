Patch a cargo to update his image or his environnements variables and redeploy them instantly.

## Update cargo image

So now we are going to change our `cargo` *my-cargo* with the git repository image we previously builded :

```sh
nanocl cargo patch my-cargo set --image get-started:master
```

You'll notice a few options being used. Here's some more info on them :

- `my-cargo` The name of the cargo you want update
- `set` The action to do there we will set new variable
- `--image` The name of the new image

We can verify if our change are made by inspecting our `cargo`

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

This should output

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME            REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    get-started:master    1

> CONTAINERS
NAMES                  IMAGE                 PORTS    STATE      STATUS          NETWORK_SETTINGS
global-dev-my-cargo    get-started:master             running    Up 2 minutes    192.168.144.3
```

The default port of our *get-started* is **9000** so we can test if access to it.

> **Note** <br />
> When you patch a cargo his related container will have ip change because it's start a new container before deleting the older one.

```sh
curl 192.168.144.3:9000
```

You should have something like this as output : 

```json
{
  "now": 1664225283833,
  "headers": {
    "host": "192.168.144.3:9000",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.17.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "ce7b054be81a",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9000",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

Congrats you have have updated your first `cargo` to a new image !

## Update cargo environnement

Now that we have updated our `cargo` to a new image, that return us the `environnement variable`, <br />
we are going to update some `environnement variable`

Let update the port used by your `cargo` by updating the **PORT** `environnement variable` :

```sh
nanocl cargo patch my-cargo set --env PORT=9001
```

As said before this will update the ip address so we run :

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

To get his new ip :

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME            REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    get-started:master    1

> ENVIRONNEMENTS
NAME    VALUE
PORT    9001

> CONTAINERS
NAMES                  IMAGE                 PORTS    STATE      STATUS               NETWORK_SETTINGS
global-dev-my-cargo    get-started:master             running    Up About a minute    192.168.144.3
```

Then to verify is the new environnement variable has been updated we can run :

```sh
curl 192.168.144.3:9001
```

That output to us :

```json
{
  "now": 1664225784742,
  "headers": {
    "host": "192.168.144.3:9001",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.17.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "6bcb6f22142f",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9001",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

Notice that we used **9001** and not 9000 this time because our service use the **PORT** environnement variable
