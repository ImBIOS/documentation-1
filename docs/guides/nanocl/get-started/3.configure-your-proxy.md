# Configure your proxy

You can create `proxy rules` using the `proxy controller` to expose your cargo. <br/>
A `proxy rule` allow you to redirect a specific ip address / port or domain name to an upstream of a cargo.

## Install nanocl proxy controller

Let's get started by installing the proxy controller:

- We can do it easily by applying this premade state

  ```sh
  nanocl state apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxthat/nanocl-ctrl-proxy/release-stable-0.2.1/.nanocl/deployment.yml
  ```

## Add proxy rules

> **Info** <br />
> To follow up the tutorial you must have a cargo called my-cargo running with port **9001** open as HTTP

Create a file called `proxy.get-started.yml` and copy the following content:

```yml
Type: Resource
ApiVersion: v0.3

Resources:
- Name: get-started.com
  Kind: ProxyRule
  Config:
    Watch:
    # Cargo to watch change for formated as follow cargo-name.namespace_name
    - my-cargo.global
    Rule:
      Http:
        Domain: get-started.com
        Network: Public
        Locations:
        - Path: /
          Target:
            Cargo:
              # Cargo to target formated as follow cargo-name.namespace_name
              Key: my-cargo.global
              Port: 9001
```

Now let's create the proxy rule by running:

```sh
nanocl state apply -f proxy.get-started.yml
```

You can see existing template with:

```sh
nanocl resource ls
```

Now we should add get-started.com to the hosts, to do so we need to get our default gateway

We can see it by running:

```sh
nanocl info
```

You should see a line with your gateway:

```yml
HostGateway: 192.x.x.x
```

```sh
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

and add the following line:
```console
192.x.x.x get-started.com
```

Now we can test that our proxy rule was working

```sh
curl get-started.com
```

Should output:

```json
{
  "now": 1659412739561,
  "headers": {
    "connection": "upgrade",
    "x-forwarded-for": "172.28.237.150",
    "host": "get-started.com",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.16.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "8c5d492b2b04",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9000",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "CLUSTER": "DEV",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

Now we know how to setup a proxy rule for our cargo enjoy deploying using Nanocl !
