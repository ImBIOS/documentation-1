# Configure your cluster

Configure your clusters with `variables` and add dynamism to your `cargoes`.

## Create a new cluster variable

You can create a `cluster variable` to use them as templating, so you can have one `cargo` that will change his configuration depending on the `cluster` he joins.

So let's create one by running:

```sh
nanocl cluster variable dev create CLUSTER DEV
```

You'll notice a few options used. Here's some more info on them:

- `dev` is the name of the cluster you want to manipulate.
- `create` the action to do, there creates a new variable.
- `CLUSTER` the key of your variable.
- `DEV` The value of your variable.

## Use cluster variable in your cargo

Once you created your `cluster variable` you can update your `cargo` to use it as follow:

```sh
nanocl cargo patch my-cargo set --env CLUSTER={{vars.CLUSTER}}
```

Then inspect the cargo:

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

You shoud see the new environnement variable: 

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME            REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest    1

> ENVIRONNEMENTS
NAME       VALUE
PORT       9001
CLUSTER    {{vars.CLUSTER}}

> CONTAINERS
NAMES                  IMAGE                 PORTS    STATE      STATUS           NETWORK_SETTINGS
global-dev-my-cargo    nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest             running    Up 13 seconds    192.168.144.2
```

Let's see if the environment variable is now visible:

```sh
curl 192.168.144.2:9001
```

```json
{
  "now": 1659411516760,
  "headers": {
    "host": "192.168.144.2:9000",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.16.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "8c5d492b2b04",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9001",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "CLUSTER": "DEV",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

As we can see we have a new `environment variable` **CLUSTER** with value **DEV** as we wanted.

## Add proxy rules to your cluster

> **Info** <br />
> To follow up the tutorial you must have a cargo called my-cargo running with port **9001** open as HTTP

Create a file called `get-started.nginx` and copy the following content:

```nginx
server {
    server_name get-started.com;
    listen 192.168.144.1:80;

    if ($host != get-started.com) {
        return 404;
    }

    location / {
      proxy_set_header upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header connection "upgrade";
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header x-forwarded-for $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header host $host;
      proxy_pass http://{{cargoes.my-cargo.target_ip}}:9001;
  }
}
```

Now let's create the template by running:

```sh
nanocl proxy template create --mode http -f get-started.nginx get-started
```

You can see existing template with:

```sh
nanocl nginx-template ls
```

Then we must link the template to the cluster
In this case, we link the template `get-started` to the cluster `dev`

```sh
nanocl proxy link dev get-started
```

We must start the cluster to generate the templated file.

```sh
nanocl cluster start dev
```

Now we should add get-started.com to the hosts
```sh
sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

and add the following line:
```console
192.168.144.1 get-started.com
```

Now we can test that our template was working

```sh
curl get-started.com
```

Should output:

```json
{
  "now": 1659412739561,
  "headers": {
    "connection": "upgrade",
    "x-forwarded-for": "172.28.237.150",
    "host": "get-started.com",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.16.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "8c5d492b2b04",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9000",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "CLUSTER": "DEV",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

Now we know how to setup a proxy rule for our cargo enjoy deploying using Nanocl !
