# Nanocl overview

Nanocl is an open platform for developing, testing, shipping, and running applications. <br />
Nanocl enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. <br />
With Nanocl, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. <br />
By taking advantage of Nanocl’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## The Nanocl platform

Nanocl provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a cargo.<br />
The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. <br />
Cargo are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.<br />
You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

Nanocl provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers :

- Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
- The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.
- When you’re ready, deploy your application into your production cluster, as a cargo. This works the same whether your production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two.
