# Orientation and Setup

> **Tags** <br />
> documentation, guides, nanocl, get started, orientation and setup

This tutorial assumes you have a current version of Nanocl installed on your machine. <br />
If you do not have Nanocl installed, see [how to install it](/docs/setups/nanocl/readme.md).


## Start the tutorial

Let's get started by creating and running a `cargo` using this command:

```sh
nanocl run --cluster dev --network front --image nginx:1.23 my-cargo
```

You'll notice a few flags used. Here’s some more info on them:

- `--cluster` To choose the cluster that your cargo will be joining it will create the cluster with default settings if needed.
- `--network` To choose the network that your cargo will access to it will create the network with default best practice if needed.
- `--image` To choose the container image used for your cargo.
- `my-cargo` The name of your cargo.

Running this command will create and start one `cargo instance` of *my-cargo* inside the `network` *front* of the `cluster` *dev*

> Note that Nanocl will choose an ipv4 address for your `cargo instance` based and the subnet of your network.
> Everything is by default with the best practice.

To know the chosen IP, inspect your `cargo` by using:

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

You should see a list of instances:

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME    REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nginx:1.23    1

> ENVIRONNEMENTS
NAME    VALUE

> INSTANCES
NAMES                  IMAGE         PORTS    STATE      STATUS          NETWORK_SETTINGS
global-dev-my-cargo    nginx:1.23    0:80     running    Up 5 minutes    192.168.144.2
```

So for me, the ipv4 address assigned is `192.168.144.2` let's curl it to see what is going on!
```
curl 192.168.144.2
```

Gave the output:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light dark; }
body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>For online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
Commercial support is available at
<a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

As you can notice we now have an Nginx `cargo instance` running on ipv4 address `192.168.144.2`

## What is a Cargo ?

Now that you’ve run a `cargo`, what is a `cargo`? <br />
Cargoes are lightweight configurations based on a container image, containing everything needed to deploy and scale your application or share it while working to be sure that everyone gets it works the same way.
They aim to join a cluster along with a network, when performing the join operation a cargo will create `cargo instances`.
Based on the number of Nanocl nodes and the number of replicas you need. They also can autoscale based on ressources available on your hosts.

> **Info** <br />
> If you’re familiar with `Kubernetes` think of a
> cargo as a version of a `pod`. <br />

To list your Cargoes you can do it by running:

```sh
nanocl cargo ls
```

It should output something like this:

```console
KEY                NAME        IMAGE         REPLICAS    NAMESPACE
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nginx:1.23    1           global
```

In a more general way to manage our `cargoes` we will use:
```sh
nanocl cargo
```

You can see available commands by running:

```
nanocl cargo help
```

That output:

```console
Manage cargoes

Usage: nanocl cargo [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list      List existing cargo
  create    Create a new cargo
  remove    Remove cargo by it's name
  inspect   Inspect a cargo by it's name
  patch     Update a cargo by it's name
  instance  Manage cargo instances
  image     Manage cargo image
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --namespace <NAMESPACE>  namespace to target by default global is used
  -h, --help                   Print help information
  -V, --version                Print version information
```

To summarize, a `Cargo`:

- Is a lightweight configuration based on a container image
- Contains every configuration needed to deploy your application
- Join a cluster along his network
- Will spawn and manage containers, called `cargo instances` that can be autoscaled

## What is a cluster ?

A `cluster` is an isolated environment where you can create networks for your `cargoes` and connect them.
That isolation can be customized depending on how you set your proxy rules.

You can list your existing clusters by running:
```
nanocl cluster ls
```

That should show you a cluster dev as follow:

```console
KEY           NAMESPACE    NAME    PROXY_TEMPLATES
global-dev    global       dev
```

You can inspect your cluster by running:

```sh
nanocl cluster inspect dev
```

It will output something like this:

```console
> CLUSTER
KEY           NAME    NAMESPACE    PROXY_TEMPLATES
global-dev    dev     global

> VARIABLES
NAME    VALUE

> NETWORKS
KEY                 NAME     CLUSTER_KEY    DEFAULT_GATEWAY
global-dev-front    front    global-dev     192.168.144.1

> CARGOES
NETWORK_KEY         KEY                NAME        IMAGE         REPLICAS    NAMESPACE
global-dev-front    global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nginx:1.23    1           global
```

In a more general to manage Nanocl clusters way we use:

```sh
nanocl cluster
```

To see available command you can us:

```sh
nanocl cluster help
```

That will output:

```console
Manage clusters

Usage: nanocl cluster [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list      List existing cluster
  create    Create a new cluster
  remove    Remove one cluster
  start     Start one cluster
  inspect   Display detailed information on one cluster
  network   Manage cluster networks
  variable  Manage cluster variables
  join      Create cargo instances inside given cluster and network
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --namespace <NAMESPACE>  Namespace to target by default global is used
  -h, --help                   Print help information (use `--help` for more detail)
```

To summarize, a `Cluster`:

- Can store variables to setup proxy rule and cargo environment variables
- Can replicate between physical host
- Can create networks
- Can run and scale cargo


## What is a cargo instance ?

Now that you know what a `Cargo` is, what is a `Cargo instance`?
A Cargo instance is exactly like a container but with possibly multiple instances of the same Cargo. It’s a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups, features that have been in Linux for a long time.

To summarize, a `Cargo instance`:

- Is most likely a container instance where `Cargo` is the configuration.
- is a runnable instance of a `Container image`. You can create, start, stop, move, or
  delete a cargo instance using the Nanocl API or CLI.
- can be run on local machines or virtual machines.
- is portable (can be run on any OS)
- are isolated from each other and run their software, binaries, and
  configurations.

## What is a container image ?

Running a `Cargo` will spawn `Cargo Instance` that uses a filesystem isolated.
This filesystem is known as `Container image` and contains the container instance’s filesystem, which must have everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc.
The image also contains other configurations for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.

We won't get dive deeper into containers and images, and covering all topics will be long, you should take a look into the [Docker documentation](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)

> **Info** <br />
> If you’re familiar with `chroot` think of a
> container as an extended version of `chroot`. <br />
> The filesystem is simply coming from the image.
> But, a container adds additional isolation not available when simply using chroot.

## What is a namespace ?

A `namespace` in Nanocl encapsulates clusters and cargoes.
For example, if you have different domain names like *facebook.com*, *instagram.com*,
you may separate them into a different namespace.
