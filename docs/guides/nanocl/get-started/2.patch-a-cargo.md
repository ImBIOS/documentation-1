Patch a cargo to update his image or his environment variables and redeploy them instantly.

## Download get started image

First, let's download the official Nanocl get started image.
We will do it using this command:

```sh
nanocl cargo image create nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest
```

## Update cargo image

So now letâ€™s change our `Cargo` *my-cargo* with the image we previously downloaded:

```sh
nanocl cargo patch my-cargo set --image nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest
```

You'll notice a few options being used. Here's some more info on them:

- `my-cargo` is the name of the cargo you want to update
- `set` is an action to do there we will set new a value
- `--image` is the value we want to change and it's the cargo image
- `nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest` is the new image name


We can verify if our changes are made by inspecting our `cargo`:

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

This should output

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME                           REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY    
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest    1                                                  

> ENVIRONNEMENTS
NAME    VALUE    

> INSTANCES
NAMES                  IMAGE                                PORTS    STATE      STATUS           NETWORK_SETTINGS    
global-dev-my-cargo    nexthat/nanocl-get-started:latest             running    Up 39 seconds    192.168.144.3
```

The default port of our *get-started* is **9000** so we can test if access to it.

> **Note** <br />
> When you patch a cargo a related container will have an IP change because it starts a new container before deleting the older one.

```sh
curl 192.168.144.3:9000
```

You should have something like this as output:

```json
{
  "now": 1664225283833,
  "headers": {
    "host": "192.168.144.3:9000",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.17.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "ce7b054be81a",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9000",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

Congrats you have updated your first `cargo` to a new image!

## Update cargo environnement

Now that we have updated our `cargo` to a new image, that returns us the `environment variables`, <br />
we are going to update some `Environnement variables`

Let's update the port used by your `cargo` by updating the **PORT** `environment variable`:

```sh
nanocl cargo patch my-cargo set --env PORT=9001
```

As said before this will update the IP address so we run:

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

To get his new IP:

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME            REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    get-started:master    1

> ENVIRONNEMENTS
NAME    VALUE
PORT    9001

> CONTAINERS
NAMES                  IMAGE                 PORTS    STATE      STATUS               NETWORK_SETTINGS
global-dev-my-cargo    get-started:master             running    Up About a minute    192.168.144.2
```

Then to verify is the new environnement variable has been updated we can run:

```sh
curl 192.168.144.2:9001
```

That output to us:

```json
{
  "now": 1664225784742,
  "headers": {
    "host": "192.168.144.3:9001",
    "user-agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "accept": "*/*"
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_VERSION": "16.17.0",
    "HOSTNAME": "6bcb6f22142f",
    "YARN_VERSION": "1.22.19",
    "PORT": "9001",
    "HOME": "/home/node",
    "TERM": "xterm",
    "PATH": "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
    "HOST": "0.0.0.0",
    "PWD": "/home/node/app"
  }
}
```

Notice that we used **9001** and not 9000 this time because our service uses the **PORT** environment variable.
