<h4>
Welcome! We are excited that you want to learn nanocl.
</h4>

<p id="nxtmdoc-meta-description">
This page contains step-by-step instructions on how to get started with nanocl.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Build and run an image or git repository as a cargo
- Deploy inside a cluster
- Deploy from a file
</p>

<h2>Download and install nanocl</h2>

This tutorial assumes you have a current version of nanocl installed on your
machine.</br> If you do not have nanocl installed, see
[how to install](./../../installation).

To better understand Nanocl let's get started with couple terms so you don't get lost.

<h2>What is a container?</h2>

Now that you’ve run a container, what is a container? Simply put, a container is
a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on
the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups,
features that have been in Linux for a long time. To summarize, a container:

- is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or
  delete a container using the nanocl API or CLI.
- can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
- is portable (can be run on any OS)
- are isolated from each other and run their own software, binaries, and
  configurations.

<h2>What is a container image?</h2>

When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem
is provided by a **container image**. Since the image contains the container’s
filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all
dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains
other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default
command to run, and other metadata.

We’ll dive deeper into images later on, covering topics such as layering, best
practices, and more.

 <strong>Info</strong>
 <p>If you’re familiar with <code class="plaintext">chroot</code> think of a
 container as an extended version of <code class="plaintext">chroot</code>.</br>
 The filesystem is simply coming from the image.</br>
 But, a container adds additional isolation not available when simply using chroot.</p>

<h2>What is a namespace?</h2>

A namespace is basically used to have a name where everything is stored.
It's usually used to separate project.

<h2>What is a cluster?</h2>

A <code class="plaintext">cluster</code>
is a scallable isolated environement where you can create network for your backend and front end and connect them together.</br>
That isolation is based on networks you create and how you defined your proxy. To summarize, a cluster:

- Can store variable to setup proxy config and environement variables
- Can replicate between physical host
- Can create network
- Can create containers based on cargo

<h2> What is a cargo?</h2>

A cargo is a pre configurated container ready to be deployed inside a cluster.</br>
It will start one or more container based on the given image.</br>
To summarize, a cargo is a replicable container who can be autoscalled.
