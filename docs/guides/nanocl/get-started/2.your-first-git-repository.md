Build your git repository as a container image to keep your project up to date. <br />
When you build a git repository it will look for existing container image, and flag the older one as backup. <br />
So you can easily backup if a deploy goes wrong.

> **Note** <br />
> Currently only *github* is implemented for this feature.

## Configure your credentials

> In order to prevent api request limit we highly recommand you to use basic credientials. <br />
> This will also allow you to have acces to private repositories.

You can configure your github credential in `/etc/nanocl/nanocl.conf` as follow :

```yml
github_user: your_github_user
github_token: your_github_token
```

You'll notice a two keys being used. Here’s some more info on them :
- `github_user` Your github username or organization name.
- `github_token` A Generated token from your github.com dashboard.

## Create your git repository

To follow next steps of the tutorial we recommand that you use our getting-started repository. <br />
It's a simple express application that will serve us environement variables. <br />
To create a new git repository in nanocl we use the following command :

```sh
nanocl git-repository create --url https://github.com/nxthat/nanocl-getting-started get-started
```

You'll notice a few flags being used. Here’s some more info on them :

- `--url` The url of your repository that contain a Dockerfile<br />
- `get-started` Is the name of your repository

## Build your git repository

After having create our get started repository we must build it. <br />
It will create a container image that will be used to create a cargo. <br />
Build you repository by using :

```sh
nanocl git-repository build get-started
```

> **Note** <br />
> By default the default branch will be used for the build

In a more general way to manage our git repositories we will use :

```sh
nanocl git-repository
```

You can get list of available commands by running :

```sh
nanocl git-repository help
```

That will output :

```console
nanocl-git-repository
