# Orientation and Setup

> **Tags** <br />

#### Welcome! We are excited that you want to learn Nanocl.

This page contains step-by-step instructions on how to get started with Nanocl. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to :

- Build and run an container image as a `cargo`
- Create a `cluster`
- Create a `network`
- Add variables to a `cluster`
- Add environement variable to a `cargo`

## Download and install Nanocl

This tutorial assumes you have a current version of Nanocl installed on your machine.<br />
If you do not have Nanocl installed, see [how to install](/docs/setups/nanocl/readme.md).

## Start the tutorial

Let's get started by creating and running a `cargo` using this command :

```sh
nanocl run --cluster dev --network front --image nginx:1.23 my-cargo
```

You'll notice a few flags being used. Here’s some more info on them :

- `--cluster` To choose the cluster that your cargo will be joining it will create the cluster with default settings if needed.
- `--network` To choose the network that your cargo will access to it will create the network with default best practice if needed.
- `--image` To choose the container image used for your cargo.
- `my-cargo` The name of your cargo.

Running this command will create and start a `cargo` called *my-cargo* and he will join the `network` *front* of the `cluster` *dev*

> Note that Nanocl will choose a valides ipv4 addresses for your cargo based and the subnet of your network. <br />
> Everything is setup by default with the best practice. <br />

To get the ipv4 addresses choosen you can inspect your `cargo` by using :

```sh
nanocl cargo inspect my-cargo
```

That should give you that output :

```console
> CARGO
KEY                NAME        IMAGE_NAME    REPLICAS    DOMAINNAME    HOSTNAME    DNS_ENTRY
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nginx:1.23    1

> ENVIRONNEMENTS
NAME    VALUE

> CONTAINERS
NAMES                  IMAGE         PORTS    STATE      STATUS          NETWORK_SETTINGS
global-dev-my-cargo    nginx:1.23    0:80     running    Up 5 minutes    192.168.144.2
```

So for me the ipv4 address asigned is `192.168.144.2` let's curl it to see what is going on !
```
curl 192.168.144.2
```

Gave the output :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
<style>
html { color-scheme: light dark; }
body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
working. Further configuration is required.</p>

<p>For online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.<br/>
Commercial support is available at
<a href="http://nginx.com/">nginx.com</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

As you can notice we now have a nginx `container` running on ipv4 address `192.168.144.2`

## What is a cargo ?

Now that you’ve run a `cargo`, what is a `cargo` ? <br />
Simply put, a cargo is a pre configurated container ready to be deployed inside a `cluster`. <br />
It will start one or more container based on the given image.

> **Info** <br />
> If you’re familiar with `kubernetes` think of a
> cargo as a version of a `pod`. <br />

To list your cargo you can do it by running :

```sh
nanocl cargo ls
```

It should output something like this :

```console
KEY                NAME        IMAGE         REPLICAS    NAMESPACE
global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nginx:1.23    1           global
```

In a more general way to manage our cargoes we will use :
```sh
nanocl cargo
```

You can see available commands by running :

```
nanocl cargo help
```

That output :

```console
nanocl-cargo
Manage cargoes

USAGE:
    nanocl cargo [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
        --namespace <NAMESPACE>    namespace to target by default global is used
    -h, --help                     Print help information
    -V, --version                  Print version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    list       List existing cargoes
    create     Create a new cargo
    remove     Remove cargo by it's name
    inspect    Inspect a cargo by it's name
    patch      Update a cargo by it's name
    help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

To summarize, a `cargo` :

- Is a replicable container who can be autoscalled that run inside a cluster.

## What is a cluster ?

A `cluster` is a scallable isolated environement where you can create network for your backend and frontend and connect them together.
That isolation is based on the networks you create and how you defined your proxy.

You can list your existing cluster by running :
```
nanocl cluster ls
```

That should show you a cluster dev as follow :

```console
KEY           NAMESPACE    NAME    PROXY_TEMPLATES
global-dev    global       dev
```

You can inspect your cluster by running :

```sh
nanocl cluster inspect dev
```

It will output something like this :

```console
> CLUSTER
KEY           NAME    NAMESPACE    PROXY_TEMPLATES
global-dev    dev     global

> VARIABLES
NAME    VALUE

> NETWORKS
KEY                 NAME     CLUSTER_KEY    DEFAULT_GATEWAY
global-dev-front    front    global-dev     192.168.144.1

> CARGOES
NETWORK_KEY         KEY                NAME        IMAGE         REPLICAS    NAMESPACE
global-dev-front    global-my-cargo    my-cargo    nginx:1.23    1           global
```

In a more general to manage Nanocl clusters way we use :

```sh
nanocl cluster
```

To see available command you can use :

```sh
nanocl cluster help
```

That will output :

```console
nanocl-cluster
Manage clusters

USAGE:
    nanocl cluster [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
        --namespace <NAMESPACE>    Namespace to target by default global is used
    -h, --help                     Print help information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    list              List existing clusters
    create            Create new cluster
    remove            Remove cluster by it's name
    start             Start cluster by it's name
    inspect           Inspect cluster by it's name
    nginx-template    Control cluster nginx templates
    network           Control cluster networks
    variable          Control cluster variables
    join              Create containers instances of a cargo inside given cluster and network
    help              Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

To summarize, a `cluster` :

- Can store variable to setup proxy config and cargo environement variables
- Can replicate between physical host
- Can create network
- Can run and scale cargo

## What is a container ?

Now that you know what is a `cargo`, what is a `container` ? <br />
A container is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on
the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups,
features that have been in Linux for a long time.
To summarize, a container:

- is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or
  delete a container using the nanocl API or CLI.
- can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
- is portable (can be run on any OS)
- are isolated from each other and run their own software, binaries, and
  configurations.

## What is a container image ?

When running a `container`, it uses an isolated filesystem. <br />
This custom filesystem is provided by a `container image`. <br />
Since the image contains the container’s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all
dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. <br />
The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default
command to run, and other metadata.

We wont get dive deeper into images, covering all topics will be long, we recommand you to look into the [docker documentation](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)

> **Info** <br />
> If you’re familiar with `chroot` think of a
> container as an extended version of `chroot`. <br />
> The filesystem is simply coming from the image.
> But, a container adds additional isolation not available when simply using chroot.

## What is a namespace ?

A `namespace` in Nanocl is basically used to have a name where everything is stored.
It's usually used to separate project.<br />
For example, if you have different domain name like *facebook.com*, *instagram.com*,
you way want separate them into different namespace.
